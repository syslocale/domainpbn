**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been built. The FastAPI backend provides API endpoints for all required data models (PBNs, Packages, Blog, FAQs, Pages, Settings, and Domains). The React frontend includes all public-facing pages and a complete admin panel for CRUD operations on all content. A WYSIWYG editor with a dark theme is integrated into the admin panel for managing blog and static page content. The Aged Domain feature has been added, including the backend API, public listing page, and an admin page with UI for CSV/Excel import.
